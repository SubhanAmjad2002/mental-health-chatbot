                Mental Health Companion was created with a simple goal: to make
                mental health support more accessible, immediate, and
                personalized. We believe that everyone should have access to
                tools that can help them navigate difficult emotions, understand
                their mental health, and find appropriate resources when needed.

                While our AI chatbot is not a replacement for professional
                mental health services, it serves as a bridgeâ€”offering support
                during moments when you might feel alone, providing
                evidence-based information, and guiding you toward professional
                resources when appropriate.

                Our platform is built using advanced AI technology, specifically
                designed to engage in supportive, empathetic conversations about
                mental health. The chatbot has been trained to:

                <li>Recognize signs of distress and respond appropriately</li>
                <li>Provide evidence-based coping strategies and resources</li>
                <li>Avoid giving medical advice or diagnoses</li>
                <li>Recognize when to suggest professional help</li>
